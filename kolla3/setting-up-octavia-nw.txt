By default, kolla-ansible creates a VXLAN named lb-mgmt-net.

Get port of DHCP server on that network:
openstack port list --network lb-mgmt-net 

Get DHCP server's host: 
openstack network agent list --network lb-mgmt-net

Create port on same host. It's only purpose is reserving an IP address on this network: 
openstack port create --network lb-mgmt-net --device-owner octavia --host k1 lb-mgmt-port

Find VLAN ID associated with DHCP server's interface
ssh k1 sudo docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ovsdb-client dump unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock Open_vSwitch Port name tag
	Port table
	name           tag
	-------------- ---
	br-ex          []
	...
	tap4df0c7a2-27 1
The NIC's name starts with "tap", then the first 12 characters of the port ID. 
Here the VLAN ID (tag) is 1.

Create a bridge port in br-int and give it the same tag:
ssh k1 sudo docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ovs-vsctl add-port br-int o-hm0 tag=1 -- set interface o-hm0 type=internal
These are two commands in one, separated by a double dash.

Obtain lb-mgmt-port's IP address:
IPADDR=$(openstack port show lb-mgmt-port -c fixed_ips -f yaml | awk '/ip_address/ {print $3}')

Bring o-hm0 up and give it the IP address of lb-mgmt-port:
ssh k1 sudo ip a add ${IPADDR}/24 dev o-hm0
ssh k1 sudo ip l set o-hm0 up
