Create a Ubuntu disk: make-ubuntu.sh. Access the Ubuntu console and install the machine.
To avoid modifying or deleting it: chattr +i ubuntu...qcow2

Create three Kolla servers: for i in 1 2 3; do make-server.sh $i; done

Use their consoles to fix the network.
Username is stack, password was set when installing Ubuntu; normally: pw
Netplan: Correct interface names and addresses.
/etc/hosts: Add k1, k2, k3, labserver.
hostnamectl
On k2, k3: cd /etc/ssh; sudo rm ssh_host*; sudo ssh-keygen -A

k1 is the deployer. Copy essentials files to it, then log on.

scp daemon.json globals.yml kolla-notes.txt multinode prepare* stack@k1:
ssh stack@k1

Manually do the first steps in prepare.sh. The rest can be executed as a script.

Create SSH identity and copy it to k2 and k3
